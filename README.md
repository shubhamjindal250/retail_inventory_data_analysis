📦 Retail Inventory & Delivery Performance Dashboard – Power BI Project
📌 Overview

This project delivers a complete end-to-end Power BI analysis of a Retail Inventory & Shipment dataset. It covers data cleaning, transformation, modeling, DAX calculations, and the creation of an interactive dashboard that provides insights into warehouse performance, shipment modes, customer satisfaction, product importance, and delivery efficiency.

The objective is to help understand operational patterns, identify delay drivers, optimize warehouse processes, and support logistics-driven decision-making.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation (Power Query)

Before analysis, the dataset required structured cleaning. Key steps:

Correcting data types (Number, Text, Currency).

Removing blanks, invalid, or duplicate rows.

Standardizing fields (Warehouse Block, Shipment Mode, Product Importance).

Extracting clean fields for aggregation.

Building a clean semantic model for reporting.

🧮 DAX Measures Used

Essential DAX measures used in the dashboard:

Total Revenue

Average Revenue per Order

Average Customer Rating

Total Quantity

Quantity by Mode of Shipment

Quantity by Warehouse Block

On-Time Delivery %

Delayed Deliveries Count

Product Importance Quantity Split

These measures allow performance analysis across logistics, customer behavior, and warehouse operations.

📢 Impact & Key Insights (Story of the Dashboard)

Below are the most important insights derived from the dashboard—these form the core impact of your analysis.

1️⃣ Ship Mode Handles the Most Quantity but Causes Most Delays

Ship is the highest-used shipment mode and also shows the most late deliveries.

Impact: Shift urgent deliveries to Road/Flight to improve on-time performance.

2️⃣ Low & Medium Importance Products Dominate Inventory Movement

Low-importance and medium-importance products drive the bulk of the quantity.

Impact: Inventory teams must focus on these categories for stock planning.

3️⃣ Warehouse Block F is Overloaded Compared to A–D

Warehouse F processes nearly twice the orders of other blocks.

Impact: Redistribute load across warehouses to avoid delays and workload imbalance.

4️⃣ Delivery Delays Are High (~40%)

A significant percentage of shipments do not reach on time.

Impact: Review logistics partners, routes, and SLA adherence.

5️⃣ Customer Ratings Are Low (≈2.99)

Despite high shipment volume, customer satisfaction is poor.

Impact: Improve last-mile delivery, reduce complaints, and enhance service quality.

6️⃣ Product Importance Affects Delivery Speed

High-importance products are fewer but receive better delivery priority.

Impact: Expand prioritization rules to ensure consistent service quality across all product categories.

🧵 Overall Story of the Data

The dashboard reveals that operations are productively high-volume, but performance is impacted by:

Imbalanced warehouse workloads

Inefficient shipment modes

High late-delivery rate

Low customer satisfaction

Uneven prioritization rules

The business can significantly improve by optimizing:

Shipment mode allocation

Warehouse workload distribution

Delivery SLAs

Inventory planning for popular products

The story is simple:
Improve logistics → reduce delays → increase customer satisfaction → grow business performance.
